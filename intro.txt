Hi, I’m Yatharth. I’ve recently started my journey in college, 
where I’m focused on excelling in academics and mastering one core field of computer science.
I’m driven to achieve a 9-pointer GPA while also building a strong practical foundation by 
competing in hackathons like SIH and GSoC. My goal is not just to participate, 
but to win, get acknowledged, and make a mark through innovation and teamwork. 
I see hackathons and academics as stepping stones toward becoming a true expert 
and leaving a lasting impact in my field.
